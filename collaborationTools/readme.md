# Online collaboration - the need for greater intelligence

## The new normal
It's fair to say that home working and remove collaboration are now a standard working practice and standard for almost all office workers.    from banking call centers enabling their teams to work from home, to large innovation workshops moving to Zoom I can't recall such a dramatic shift in the change in the methods of working in my lifetime.   Like many people I've seen invites to many different platforms over the past 6 months; platforms or solutions to allow either video conferencing or online collaboration; it's been the online collaboration combined with the video conferencing where the value and speed by which the output is created is where I've seen the biggest gains.
