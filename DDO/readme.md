Everything we do creates some form of data, the challenge and opportunity for every organisation is to harness that data to unlock even great value.  The more an organisation can connect this information, the more value and efficiencies  can be realized.

I see 3 core aspects which need to understood to create a fully data driven organisation

## Know the Market

Understanding the current and potential direction of any market is key to the success of any business, this key foundational aspect defines how far beyond the current horizon an organisation can sense and adapt to change.

### Getting started - Inside viewpoint

Creating **communities of interest and practice** brings experts together, sharing new developments within the market and discussing how this impacts the current organisation is a must; learning from our shared experiences is key.

Internal **support teams**, can help foster both the documentation and sharing of this knowledge, as well as provide key services to help teams research a given topic; providing structure and maintaining records of trusted sources for a given topic or industry.


### Outside - In

Engaging with **external analysts** is the first step towards truly understanding the market direction, their breath of knowledge through multiple relationships can accelerate your viewpoints on the potential changes within a market; they can also assist with understand the future value of these new markets.

### Sensing engines
The growth of social media and open data has had allow organisations to gain some of the insights external analysts can provide themselves; democratizing the knowledge.   However an organisation needs to be aware that unlocking this knowledge does require investment; new and redirected investment from more traditional approaches such as external analysts.  Note, I am not saying all ties with external analysts should be cut, these relationships are key are form a key part of brand and capability awareness with the outside markets, by combining the two an organisation has the potential to dramatically change the  relationship with the market analysts; it becomes a discussion on change as opposed to just listening and adaption to their recommendations.

#### Automated platforms
From the early 1980's platforms such as [Bloomberg's Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_Terminal) have been pulling together vast datasets to allow experts to estimate and forecast the potential direction of the financial markets, however it has only been within recent years that other industries have started to look at the potential of such platforms; cross industry solutions such as [xModus](https://xmotus.io/) and [Faethm](https://faethm.ai/) catalog and model a wide range of social media and other data sources, allowing business analysts the means to cross reference and research a range of topics.   For example, the relationship and potential of *5G* and *autonomous driving *.  Other solutions such as [Fibres](https://www.fibresonline.com/) build upon this concept, allowing you to build upon your existing analysts relationships and combine their knowledge into open data sets.

## Understand your customers

We all know listening to customers is key, but writing it down it just as important. An organisation needs the ability to capture and relate their customers requirements to both the market direction and their own internal capabilities; it's the key point of any data driven organisation.

### Good CRM practices


### Intelligent analytics
#### Self service to fully automated customer 360 platforms.




## Understand your own capabilities


## The power of connections


## Underpinnings

A key under pinning of all these aspects of a data driven organisation, is a common and maintained taxonomy and information model across the organisation, in fact I would go as far to say this is the first step any organisation has to take; defining a common language and taxonomy not only saves the well documented pains of data consolidation, but
